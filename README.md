# Team Page Generator
A simple CLI program that takes information about your team and generates a webpage to display that information.

## Pitch

Look no further than this Team Page Generator. Just enter all of your team's info into the terminal (such as Employee ID, email address, and GitHub username), and a simple HTML file will be generated with quick links to help you stay organized and connected to your team members.
