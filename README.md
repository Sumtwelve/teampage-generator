# Team Page Generator
A simple CLI program that takes information about your team and generates a webpage to display that information.

## Pitch
Are you managing a small commercial team, or collaborating with a few other programmers on a passion project? Tired of losing important info about your team members? Look no further than this Team Page Generator. Just enter all of your team's info (such as Employee ID, email address, and GitHub username), and a simple HTML file will be generated with quick links to help you stay organized and connected to your team members.
